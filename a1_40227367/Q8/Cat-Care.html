                <h3>Feeding</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cats need taurine, an amino acid, for their heart and eye health. </li>
                    <li>Fresh and clean water is necessary at all times, and washing your cat;s water bowl on a daily is
                        recommended.</li>
                    <li>Treats should make up at most 10% of your cat's diet.</li>
                    <li>Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well.
                        Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could
                        be poisoned.</li>
                    <li>Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue
                        for more than two days.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Scratching</h3>
                <p>Cats need to scratch! When a cat scratches, the old outer nail sheath is pulled off and the sharp,
                    smooth claws underneath are exposed.
                    Cutting your cat’s nails every two to three weeks will keep them relatively blunt and less likely to
                    harm the arms of both humans and furniture.
                    Provide your cat with a sturdy scratching post, at least three feet high.
                    The post should also be stable enough that it won't wobble during use, and should be covered with
                    rough material such as sisal, burlap or tree bark. Many cats also like scratching pads.</p>
