                        <p>Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy.
                            Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health.
                            Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors.
